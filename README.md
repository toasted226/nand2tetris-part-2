# Nand2Tetris Part 2

Nand2Tetris Part 2 is a course continuing from Nand2Tetris Part 1, in which you start with building a virtual stack machine with a translator to translate VM code (similar to Java's bytecode or C#'s IL) into assembly language.
By the end of the course, you build a compiler for a higher-level language that translates into aforementioned VM code and finally compiles down to assembly, as well as a small Operating System to provide more built-in functionality
and abstraction over important parts like math, strings and a shell.
